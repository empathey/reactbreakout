# React Native Breakout
Breakout is a game originally made for the Atari 2600. This version of Breakout is for Android and IOS. It was animated using the React Native Reanimated library. I chose to port the game to React Native because it would allow me to make the game from a single code base without needing to learn multiple languages. Knowing the serious technical difficulties with making games on React Native, this was a game that I was inspired to make because it functions extremely well in React Native.
