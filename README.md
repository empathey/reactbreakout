# React Native Breakout
### Breakout is a game original made for the Atari 2600. This version Breakout was recreated using the React Native Reanimated library. I chose React Native because it would allow me to make  game from a single code base without needkng to learn multiple language. Knowing the serious technical difficulties with making games on React Native, this was a game that I was inspired to make because it functions extremely well in React Native.
